								<p> 
								I am currently working as an Engineer at Dominion Energy, Virginia, USA. 
								In my current role, I lead a forecasting initiative 
								for data-center-heavy regions where behind-the-meter generation is expanding rapidly. 
								Our goal is to incorporate probabilistic forecasting methodologies to systems operation 
								reliability studies and to provide insights on the uncertainty of load and generation in 
								Northern Virginia. <p> 
								
								<p> My research interests include probabilistic methods for power systems applications, Energy Markets, 
								and reliability analysis. I have co-authored several research papers in reputed journals and conferences 
								in the field of power systems, and data science.<p> 

								<p> I have completed a dual master's degree in Electrical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic 
								Institute and Data Science from Chennai Mathematical Institute in 2024 and 2022 respectively.
								I also worked as an intern at Dominion Energy, Legato Health Technologies, 
								imec, INESC TEC while pursuing my masters. Prior to this, I have completed my B.Tech in 
								Electrical Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Durgapur in 2018.
                                After graduation, I worked with Jindal Stainless Limited as an Associate Manager at 
								Cold Rolling Mill Electrical and Automation department. <p> 
		
                                <p> Outside of work, I am an avid traveler, nature enthusiast, and a trained Indian 
									classical singer.<p>

                                                                    I enjoyed most at CMI.
